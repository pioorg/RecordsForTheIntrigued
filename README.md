# Java™ records for the intrigued


This is a demo project to show features of Java™ Records.
It uses `--enable-preview` and Maven, but you don't need to have Maven installed.

To run this project, you need to have Java™ 16 installed. You can use https://sdkman.io/ and/or https://openjdk.java.net/, https://adoptopenjdk.net/.

If you'd like to run the example app, one of the options is this:

    $ ./mvnw exec:java

(If it doesn't work, you might have Java 16 not installed.)

## Other Java 16 features
